If anyone ever wanted visualizations on this material, here it is.

Data used from samples.json. HTML page features javascript visualizations including a bar chart, a scatter plot and a gauge. All are interactive, and change upon the user's selected ID.

The bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs for the individual. The scatter plot displays all OTUs with dots representing the size of the sample values from the dataset for the selected individual. The gauge shows the washing frequency of each individual.
